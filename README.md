# UBC RateMyCoffs
The purpose of this application is to provide a coffee reviews platform exclusive to UBC students. Users can publish ratings and reviews for every coffee shop on campus, as well as see a full coffee shop ranking based on the positive to negative review ratio - similar to RottenTomatos' form of reviews. I built this project as 1) a way to become familiar with useful concepts in full stack development such as a CRUD API or implementing server/client interaction, and 2) to expand my knowledge with the MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.
